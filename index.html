	<h4>Work</h4>

	<p>With extensive experience in technology leadership, I have navigated roles ranging from startup founder to CTO and VP of Engineering, while also leading technology strategies in larger corporate settings.</p>
	
	<p>My expertise lies in designing, architecting, and engineering complex software systems, spanning technology, teams, and processes. I have worked on a variety of applications including web, social, mobile, hardware, and SaaS platforms.</p>
	
	<p>In my most recent role at Included Health, I focused on enhancing engineering excellence, improving engineering efficiency, and refining software architecture practices. My goal was to optimize our engineering workflows and enable our mission to deliver top-notch healthcare outcomes for our members.</p>
	
	<p>At Uber, I led the technical aspects of the bikes and scooters division, managing the JUMP acquisition integration, and scaling the infrastructure to accommodate rapid growth—reaching 45k vehicles, 2M+ monthly trips, and over $150M in annualized revenue—all while collaborating closely with a team of over 50 engineers.</p>
	
	<p>I currently manage a small team of software engineers at my company, providing leading aviation maintenance management services for General Aviation through SavvyAviation.</p>
	
	<p>I hold a Master of Information Networking from Carnegie Mellon University and a Bachelor of Information Systems Engineering from Imperial College, London.</p>
	
	<p>I am also an inventor with seven U.S. patents to my name and several pending patent applications.</p>

	<p>My bio is also available here: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thanosd" target='_blank'>linkedin.com/in/thanosd</a>

	<p>I no longer infrequently post to Twitter.</p>
